## 4. Planning and Development
### 4.1 Wireframes
Before diving into the code, I created wireframes to get a solid idea of how the game would look and flow. These wireframes helped me lay out where everything would go on the screen—things like the game board, score tracker, timer, buttons for restarting, and instructions. I made sure to keep it simple and focused on the key elements: the 3x3 grid of clickable tiles. As for the Trump character, I wanted to tie it into the current world vibe, especially with the whole "fake news" thing he’s known for. It just seemed like a fitting touch!

### 4.2 Colour Palette
For the colors, I wanted to keep it bold and eye-catching but also not too overwhelming. I chose a black background to make the podiums, reported and trump character to stand out. The colors, logos and images give it a bit of a “news channel” vibe while keeping things playful.


### 4.3 Typography
The typography used in the game includes:
- **Fonts**: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
- **Game instructions**: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif

## 5. Testing and Debugging
The game underwent multiple stages of testing, including:
- **Functional testing**: Ensuring that clicking Trump increases the score and clicking reporters ends the game.
- **Timing issues**: Adjusting how often Trump and reporters spawn to create a balanced gameplay experience.
- **Sound testing**: Verifying that the sound effects play correctly when Trump is clicked and when the game ends.
- **Browser compatibility**: Ensuring the game works on major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Testing how the game behaves on different screen sizes, adjusting for mobile gameplay.
