Project Milestone 1 for Code Institute Full-Stack Development Program: HTML/CSS Essentials
This project is a Front-End website for RIBL Capital, an autonomous trading company that leverages cutting-edge AI technology, including its flagship bot, Solomon. The platform is designed to strategically execute buy and sell decisions in the financial markets with precision and efficiency. The website will introduce RIBL to potential clients, showcase its innovative vision, and highlight the advanced capabilities of its AI-driven services.

Solomon, RIBL Capital's leading AI bot, autonomously analyses market trends and real-time data, executing trades based on sophisticated algorithms designed to optimise market opportunities. The technology also has the potential to integrate machine learning for enhanced decision-making, allowing the bot to adapt and evolve over time as market conditions shift. This approach positions RIBL Capital as a forward-thinking leader in the trading industry, offering a highly efficient and independent trading system with minimal human intervention.

The website will be user-friendly, with a clean, professional design that allows visitors to easily navigate and engage with RIBL's brand. It will feature interactive elements, including a contact form for enquiries and direct links to RIBL's social media channels, ensuring clients can connect seamlessly. The site will also provide detailed insights into RIBL’s services, the AI technology of Solomon, and the key investment sectors it targets.

Fully responsive, the website will deliver an optimal experience across all devices, from desktops to smartphones, ensuring accessibility for users on any platform. With its launch scheduled for 2025, this project will establish RIBL Capital’s online presence
