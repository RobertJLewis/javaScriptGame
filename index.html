            <p>            
                Alright folks, here's the deal. The fake news is popping up everywhere, but don't worry—you've got me, and I'm the one with the truth.

                <br><br><strong>News presenters?</strong>
                They're popping up, trying to distract you, mislead you, but you've got one job: ignore them. You don't waste your time on the fake news.
                
                <br><br><strong>What do you do?</strong>
                You click me, Donald J. Trump, to get those points. That's how you win—you focus on me, and the points are going to rack up, it's going to be YUGE.
                                
                <br><br><strong>The Objective?</strong>
                So stay sharp, stay smart, and keep clicking Trump! Believe me, it's the only way to win. Don't let the media fool you, folks! And who knows, I might even give you one of my shiny gold cards, but not if you'r Mexican.
